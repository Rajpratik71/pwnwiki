# Submitting Content
We want/need your help! Please contribute to this project is via GitHub (https://github.com/pwnwiki/pwnwiki.github.io). That allows us to get your project-ready content incorporated into the wiki fast. 

## Git Updates
 * [Fork The PwnWiki Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and set up [Two-factor Authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/).
 * New topics are added by generating topic.md files in the appropriate directory. Add a new topic directory, if necessary.
 * Updates are performed by editing the topic.md file using [GitHub Wiki Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)
 * Updates performed via command line access need to be added, committed, and pushed to your forked repo.
 * Updates performed via GitHub file editing functionality need to be pulled to your local repos.
 * Contributions to the main PwnWiki can be performed via [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
 * TODO: update how to handle images and screen shots
 * TODO: update how to handle sliders and Show/Hide

## Non-Git Updates
We realize that not everyone can/wants to submit content via GitHub and that's cool. 

 * Want to discuss PwnWiki.github.io content? Talk to us at the [PwnWiki Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1N7-jRjnUXoz-UwB2h0du2IrskFJW6hBGs4YsTwvEncE/viewform). 
 * Issues can always be brought to our attention via the [PwnWiki Issue  Management](https://github.com/pwnwiki/pwnwiki.github.io/issues) page.
 * Due to the large amount of submissions and content, there may be a delay between your posting and us getting your content into the project. 

Thanks for your submissions and your patience!
