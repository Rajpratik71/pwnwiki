### Live Online Copy:
You can find a copy of the project online at: http://PwnWiki.io

### Offline Use:
This is the really cool thing about this wiki: when you do a ```git clone``` of it you get a full wiki on your local system. Do you work on a network that has no Internet access? We gotcha covered.

  1. Clone the repository or pull the archive ([download zip](https://github.com/pwnwiki/pwnwiki.github.io/archive/master.zip)) of the repo
  2. Open index.html
  3. Most modern browsers don't allow the access of local files from a locally loaded HTML file. On Windows you can use [Mongoose Tiny](http://cesanta.com/downloads.html) or [HFS](http://www.rejetto.com/hfs/) to host the files locally. On OSX and Linux `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` seems to work just fine.

**Referenced tools can be found here: https://github.com/mubix/post-exploitation (If they aren't built into the OS).**
